# whatsapp_analysis
The reason why I choose WhatsApp as my analysis is because I always wanted to know more about my chat room behaviour.In this project, I will attempt to find out what normally I will do in a group chat with my friends such as the active hours we usually talk and the number of emoji we use in the chat. 
In this analysis, we are using the personal dataset from Whatsapp chat. Everyone is able to export their own dataset from the Whatsapp group:
Before I start my analysis there is some item that you need to take noted. This dataset is from real-life chat that was created during the 24/08/2021 till 05/02/2022 period. And the main purpose of this group is to exchange knowledge and ideas during our online college life
